# 🧪 User Behavior Simulator

An AI-powered prototype that simulates user behavior to test websites and prototypes before launch. Identify friction points, usability issues, and UX problems early in the design process.

## 🎯 Overview

The User Behavior Simulator helps product teams predict how real users will interact with their interfaces by using AI personas that mimic realistic user behavior patterns. Instead of waiting for post-launch analytics, teams can now:

- **Test early**: Simulate user behavior during the design/prototype phase
- **Identify friction**: Spot drop-off points and confusion areas before they impact real users
- **Validate designs**: Test with diverse user personas including accessibility-focused users
- **Iterate quickly**: Get immediate feedback on UX decisions

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Personas
- **Pre-built personas**: Tech-savvy shoppers, cautious new users, busy parents, accessibility-focused users
- **Behavioral traits**: Each persona has specific traits (impatient, careful, price-conscious, etc.)
- **Tech savviness levels**: Personas behave differently based on their technical comfort level
- **Custom personas**: Create your own personas with specific traits and goals

### 📊 Comprehensive Analytics
- **User journey mapping**: Step-by-step visualization of user actions
- **Interaction heatmaps**: See where users focus their attention
- **Friction point detection**: Automatic identification of confusion clicks and bounce points
- **Performance metrics**: Efficiency scores, completion rates, and error analysis
- **Actionable recommendations**: Specific suggestions for UX improvements

### 🎨 Modern Interface
- **Clean dashboard**: Overview of all simulations and key metrics
- **Intuitive simulation setup**: Easy-to-use form for configuring tests
- **Rich analytics views**: Interactive charts and visualizations
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 🔧 Configuration

### Persona Customization
Create custom personas by specifying:
- **Name and description**: Clear persona identity
- **Behavioral traits**: Tags like "impatient", "thorough", "price-conscious"
- **Tech savviness**: 1-5 scale affecting interaction complexity
- **Intent**: Primary motivation or goal

### Simulation Parameters
- **Duration**: 60-1800 seconds maximum simulation time
- **Device type**: Desktop or mobile emulation
- **Goal definition**: Specific task the user should complete

## 📊 Analytics Features

### Performance Metrics
- **Efficiency Score**: Ratio of meaningful actions to total actions
- **Completion Rate**: Whether the user achieved their goal
- **Time to First Interaction**: How quickly users engage with the interface
- **Error Rate**: Frequency of confusion clicks and failed interactions

### Behavioral Insights
- **Scanning patterns**: How users visually explore the page
- **Interaction preferences**: Which elements attract user attention
- **Decision points**: Where users pause or show confusion
- **Success/failure paths**: Routes that lead to goal completion or abandonment

### Recommendations Engine
Automatically generates actionable suggestions based on:
- Detected friction points
- Persona-specific needs
- Common usability patterns
- Accessibility considerations

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding New Personas
1. Use the persona management interface or API
